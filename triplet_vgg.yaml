LATENT_SIZE: 1024         # Size of the latent vector
PERCEP_RATIO: .1          # Ratio of the Perceptual loss to other losses
KLD_RATIO: .001           # Ratio of the VAE KL Divergence to other losses
TRIP_RATIO: 1             # Ratio of the triplet loss to other losses
RECON_RATIO: 1            # Ratio of the reconstruction loss to other losses
OUTLIERS: "outliers"      # Don't change this
TRAIN_TEST_SPLIT: .7      # Ratio of train/test split. We fix the seeds so the same split is generated each time.
